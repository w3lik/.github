ðŸš€ Lik is the most powerful lua mapping framework ever, it runs on windows platform. Because singluar is too bulky and heavy to cause some problems, lik is committed to solving all the problems, it combines YD, Dz, kk and other runtime environments, and create its own runtime environment, to play a unique concept, both powerful and free.

Lik has the use of golang language management tools , and more powerful than all previous tools , it supports more advanced map hot update , more intelligent global code obfuscation encryption ( even including Chinese ) , more optimized the management of a variety of resources , can accurately prompt the user abuse of resources and the lack of power is unparalleled , non-competitive products on the market can be comparable to other.
